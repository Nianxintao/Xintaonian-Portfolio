        <p>
            Movies, Music, Dogs, and weekend lover. Never get board to feel lonely on sofa while movie is on. A meat lover pizza and bottle of milk team will satisfy my stomach, but makes me feel guilty all day lone. One sad music will make me silence for hours.

        <p>One of my biggest achievements right after the COVID time. I join the pre-opening team of Hyatt Centric in Melbourne. As a back house manager, I was in charge of housekeeping hiring, training, cleaning and decorating the 245 hotel rooms, lobby gym and swimming pool area. All the details should be done 100% when the day come. With limited man power and 12 hours working per day. Me and my team finished everything two days before the arranged the date. </p>
