        <h2>Hotel Front of house opreation</h2>

            The exact role of a front office in a hotel may vary somewhat from one hotel to another, but the general front desk receptionist duties and responsibilities are largely the same despite how big or small your property may be.<br>
            That is, first and foremost, to welcome guests and check them into their rooms. This includes managing vehicle parking for the guest during their stay, and arranging for any special requests for their rooms. <br>
            It’s also important for any receptionist to be able to assist with guest questions about the local area. This can include anything from suggestions for places to go for dinner, to the nearest supermarket and pharmacy, to directions and information about local events and attractions. <br>
            Yet even when there isn’t a guest standing at the desk asking questions or checking in, there are countless hotel front desk duties that will keep any receptionist busy.<br> 
            This includes dealing with guest issues. For example, if a guest is having trouble with their TV or has reported that there’s a leak in the bathroom, the front desk must liaise with maintenance in order to fix the issues as soon as possible. Or, a guest might request a room change, which takes a lot of organisation to manage seamlessly. 
            The front desk must also manage and prepare for upcoming bookings. They might have emails and requests from potential future guests who are asking about anything from availability to amenities, so it’s important to stay on top of these communications as efficiently and effectively as possible. <br>
            Receptionists will also liaise with housekeeping to ensure rooms are ready on time – or if a guest wishes to check in early, to determine how quickly the room can be ready. A good receptionist can also make a housekeeper’s task easier by informing them when a guest checks out early, allowing housekeeping to make a headstart on their room list for the day before the standard check out time. <br>
            It’s also often the responsibility of a receptionist to keep the lobby area clean and tidy, with up-to-date newspapers, tourism brochures, and coffee stations.<br>
